Trainee Team #2 received their first assignment this morning, a simple bug hunt on a fringe world in the Strion system. Reports from the unaligned colonization effort indicate that some form of intense mutation has undergone the local flora and fauna, at an alarming rate. Plants seem alive and were described as 'flesh-like' in the distress call we recieved. I am worried as to what may have caused these odd mutations. Let's hope the team is up to the task.

The team is set to have made landfall roughly four hours ago. We've not recieved any update on their progress or what they know, but due to the lack of new signals from Strion-08, it is safe to assume they at least made it there safely and made contact. Some video feeds were recieved from the pilot of their shuttle, however. It seems the colonizers were able to retrieve some date from their fallen personnel. The contents of the videos... disturb me. No creatures like that were reported during early scouting of the system, nor should simple mutation be able to cause such a volatile metamorphosis. I will need to research this further, and hope the team reports their findings to the shuttle pilot.
