# Mission // #001
## Bug Hunt

Seems a backwater colonization effort has gone south. An unaffiliated new colony sent out a general distress signal and we intercepted it first. Seems the local Flora and Fauna have begun rapid mutation and are becoming a serious threat.
Before these bugs can cause any more damage, you lot are being sent down to squash the infestation and gain favor with the locals.

# Goals
- Defend Strion-08's colony from attack.

# Stakes
- If the mission is failed, the Militia will lose this as a possible contact and it could expand Union-controlled space.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
